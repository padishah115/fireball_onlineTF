################
# PARENT CLASS #
################
#  Generic parent class for all outputs from all diagnostics. These outputs could be images, electric fields,
# temperatures, anything. Each Output class comes with a name, the name of the associated Device, and the shot number
# from which the Output is being taken. This allows us to develop single derivative Output classes (e.g. "image") for
# a wide variety of devices that all produce images.

#  The Output parent class also comes with an empty "analyze" function, which must be overwritten by definitions of child 
# classes. This is so that, when working with a Device object containing many Output objects, we can do things such as
# call Devices.output.analyze() for output in Device.outputs, without having to worry about what exactly the analyze()
# function is doing.
