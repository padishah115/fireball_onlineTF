# SCRIPT WHICH BUILDS DICTIONARIES OF DATA PATHS FOR SHOTS. IDEA IS THAT THIS TAKES SOME INPUT .CSV, #
#  EITHER ONE PER INSTRUMENT OR FROM ONE MASTER.CSV, AND THEN CONVERTS TO SOME DICTIONARY FORMAT     #
#Â  APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN THE MAIN CODE.                                                             #
