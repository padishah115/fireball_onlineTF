This is a prototype codebase for online data analysis at CERN's Fireball-III project.

Note: all a user needs to do is edit the ./src/run.py file, edit the ./run_manager/paths.py file, and then execute the run.py file. Eventually, the generation of the dictionaries
contained in the paths.py file will be automated by a Python script that reads from some "master.csv" file.
